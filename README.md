# Semantics!
The Semantics! library is an extention of regular expressions for creating interpreters of structured text. It supports dynamical merging of regular expressions, recursive definitions, reuse of (merged) regular expression definitions trough variables and defining how variables at each level should be interpreted by associating them with an anonymous function.
