Write test to check that assigning to variable statements only affects the 
  current execution context.
ExecutionEnvironment.variables should be lexical environment.
Remove list quantifiers from the grammar (and from the code?).
Which literals may have qualifiers?
Is this a function or an object: new function() {return function() {};};
Are the properties of window own properties?
Write group tests to check that non returned sideffects are still run, so I 
  don't accidentally disable them with select(4)
Ensure that insignificant space is parsed before and after literal 
  strings and regexes.
Are nested regex classes allowed? Then Regex body will have to be a nonterminal.
Finish numeric literal.
Is type change expression: right hand side expression the right order of 
  precedence?
Implement ellisions in arrays.
Is returnValue a good name?
Use {Object: Object} instead of window in for in test.
The expressions in for(var;;) loops should be optional. Requires break 
  statement.
